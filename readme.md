# Gulp Starter

This is a starting point for using Gulp with SASS + Breakpoint + Susy + Livereload for Chrome Browser Extension. It also does some other cool features.

[TODO - list features]

## Prequisites
There are a few Software Packages you need to install before you can get started

* node.js = https://nodejs.org/en/
* Gulp -global = http://gulpjs.com/
```
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
```
* Bower - global = https://bower.io/
```
$ npm install -g bower
```
   
## Getting Started
* Download this repo to your local machine -> use terminal to change directory to where your HTML files will be.

Then run these commands:

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ bower install
```
This will add all the contributed modules for task runners.

From there - Let's build the internet!

## Post Installation
Run this command to always look for changes and process your gulp processes.

```
$ gulp watch
```
